<title>FRIDA Exposure Time Calculator</title>

  
<h2>General description</h2>
   The FRIDA ETC is an exposure time calculator for the GTC near-infrared camera and 2-D spectrograph, FRIDA, which uses the GTC Adaptive Optics System, GTCAO. <P>The input page presents the entry fields and widgets for the target information, expected atmospheric conditions, instrument configuration,
observation parameters such as exposure time or signal-to-noise, and output selection. An &quot;Apply&quot; button
submits the parameters to the model executed on the ESO Web server. The results page presents the computed results,
including number of counts for the object and the sky, signal-to-noise ratios, instrument efficiencies, PSF size
etc.. The optional graphs are displayed as images and PDF formats for further analysis and printing.</P>
   <h2>Target and Reference Source Spectrum</h2>
   <p>In the Target Input Flux Distribution field, you can select a spectral type and filter magnitude for the target. 
   Alternatively, you can choose to specify the target with a blackbody temperature (and a filter magnitude). In spectroscopic mode, you can choose to specify a single emission line instead. In the Reference Source Parameters field, information about spectral type and filter magnitude is entered for the reference source.</p>

   <h3>Spectral Type</h3>
   <p>In imaging a stellar spectral type is used to make the color correction.</p>
   <p>In spectroscopy, a template spectrum is scaled to the provided magnitude.</p>
   The Pickles template spectra covers only the JHK bands.  The target spectrum can also be selected from a subset of
<A HREF="http://marcs.astro.uu.se/">MARCS</a>
stellar model spectra, kindly provided by Bengt Edvardsson at the
Uppsala Astronomical Observatory. The parameter space of the MARCS
subsets are listed the following tables. Note that not all models
(referring to all possible combinations of parameters) actually exist.

      <a id="objmag"></a>Target / Reference Source Magnitude
   </h3>
   <p>You must select the filter and filter magnitude for proper scaling of the template spectrum. Available filters are V, J, H, K, L and M. For extended sources, the magnitude must be given per square arc second.</p>
   <a id="sepa"></a>
   <h3>Separation of Target and Reference Source</h3>
   <p>The target is slightly off the optical axis, because another star is used as reference source. This is particularly useful if the target is very faint, since the quality of the AO correction deteriorates rapidly for reference source magnitudes greater than V=13. The reference source must be within 30 arc seconds of the primary target.</p>
   <a id="sourcegeom"></a>
   <h2>Target Spatial Distribution</h2>
   <p>The geometry of the target will affect the signal to noise, since extended sources will cover a wider area of the detector. You can either select:</p>
   <ul>
      <li><a id="ptsourcelim"></a>
         <h3>Point Source</h3></li>
      <li>
         <p>
            If point source is chosen, the target object is assumed to be an emitter with negligible angular size. This can be selected for objects with an angular radius of much less than the sky-projected pixel size, see the <a href="http://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/paranal/instruments/naco/">NACO instrument page</a> or the <a href="http://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/paranal/instruments/naco/doc">user's manual</a>. For imaging, the S/N is given in an area of radius equal to 1.22*lambda/D,
            which is 70 mas for an 8 m diameter telescope observing in the center of the K band (2.2 microns). In spectroscopy, the S/N reference area is a rectangle with dimensions*1.22 lambda/D the spatial direction and the slitwidth in the perpendicular direction.

      You must supply information about the total observation time. This can be done in terms of DIT (Detector Integration Time), which is the duration of individual exposures, and NDIT (Number of DIT's), which is the number of exposures. The total exposure time is the product of DIT times NDIT. This exposure time does not take into account instrument and telescope overheads.<br> Alternatively, you can specify a signal to noise ratio, in which case the ETC will compute the minimal number of
      individual exposures (each of duration DIT) required to reach the requested S/N ratio.

         <p>
            Since P71, NACO imaging can be performed in two exposure modes, either chopping or non-chopping. The Chopping mode can only be used for observations in M' (mandatory) and L', NB_3.74 and NB_4.05 (optional).<br> The S/N ratio in chopping mode is approximately reduced by a factor 1/sqrt(2). Please find more details about chopping in the <a href="http://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/paranal/instruments/naco/doc">NACO user's manual</a>.

         <h3>Total exposure time</h3>
         <p>For the chopping mode of NACO, the user selects the total exposure time, in minutes. The DIT (Detector Integration Time) depends on the instrument configuration. It will be set to the relevant minimal DIT. The NDIT (Number of DIT's) is then found from the total exposure time, by dividing with the DIT.</p></li>

      <a id="output">Possible Outputs in Imaging</a>
   </h2>
   <p>For the purpose of presenting the results of the calculations of the NACO Imaging ETC, you can choose from the following output options:</p>

   <h3>
      <a id="spsf">Show 2-D PSF image (jpg and FITS)</a>
   </h3>
   <p>
      Toggling this option will display two images (jpg format) of the Point-Spread Function (PSF), the first one with a linear color scale and the second one with a logarithmic color scale. In addition, a 2D FITS file with the PSF will be available for download. Note that these are monochromatic PSFs computed by the NAOS-PS software for the central wavelength of the filter used in the simulation.<br> The pixel scale in the fits image corresponds to lambda / 2D, with D being the diameter of
      the telescope. More information on the simulation parameters is available in the FITS header.
   </p>

   <h3>
      <a id="aperture">Encircled Energy as a function of Aperture Radius</a>
   </h3>

   <p>Toggling this option will display a plot of the Encicled Energy (EE) as a function of the aperture radius (arcsecs). A cross of two lines will indicate the selected aperture radius r and the value EE(r). The default aperture radius is 1.22*lambda/D (D=8.2m).</p>

   <h3>
      <a id="snexp">S/N as a function of Exposure Time</a>
   </h3>

   <p>
      Toggling this option will display the S/N as a function of exposure time. For <a href="#ptsourcelim">point sources</a> the S/N is calculated in the area of the diffraction limited core, radius equal to 1.22 lambda/D, which is 70 mas for an 8 m diameter telescope observing in the central K band (2.2 microns). For <a href="#extsource">extended sources</a>, the S/N is calculated per pixel element, using the surface brightness in magnitudes per square arcsec.
   </p>
   On the results page, the input parameters are repeated, the NACO transmission model parameters are given, sky data is given, and the S/N is plotted. See
   <a href="#txtoutput">Text Summary Results</a> for a description of the text output.Toggling both options will display a page with the input parameters, the NACO transmission model parameters, sky data and the graphs described above. Toggling no options will give you only the

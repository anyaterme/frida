Spectral distribution
The source spectrum is selected from the available libraries of stellar and non-stellar spectra, model emission line + continuum, and black body, power law and user-defined spectra. Different options are available depending on the instrument in question. The spectrum may be redshifted by an arbitrary amount. If the selected (redshifted) spectrum does not completely cover the observing wavelength range, as defined by the colour filter or dispersive element, either an error is reported by the ITC or the spectrum is padded with leading or trailing zeros.
For spectroscopic calculations, the source spectrum is smoothed to the resolution of the spectrograph as given by the dispersing element with an entrance aperture defined by the slit width, or source extent if narrower (some exceptions are noted for specific instruments). Note that the stellar and non-stellar libraries may have an intrinsic resolution less than that of the instrument or a coarser sampling. In all cases they are re-sampled to the appropriate dispersion within the ITC.
The sky transmission and sky background spectra employed currently have a resolution of ~1nm and sampling of ~0.5nm. Hence at higher instrument spectral resolutions, the sky lines will not be treated correctly.
(a) Stellar library
The Pickles (1998; PASP, 110, 863) stellar library covers optical and near-IR wavelengths out to 2.5um across a broad range of spectral types (O5 to M9) and luminosity classes (I, III and V). We have extended these spectra out to 6um, arbitrarily adopting the slope of the K0III star for all spectral types. More accurate spectrophotometry will be inserted in the ITC library as it becomes available.
(b) Non-stellar library
